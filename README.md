My passion is to utilize Data Sceince tools to facilitate the application of evidence-based & people-centred decision making in the Health sector for the improvement of lives & livelihoods in Africa. I am also very excited about building capacity on the continent by developing analytical skills among the youth with an end to developing homegrown sulitions to the present Global Health challenges
